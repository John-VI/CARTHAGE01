Started writing a log of progress on the program. Switched to a radical new diet
recently to lose some weight, threw me off a lot more than I was expecting. Not
too much got done for a while. Writing and rewriting the object manager for
efficiency and safety since we'll be creating and destroying lots of objects
very rapidly.

Added shooting. We're growing by leaps and bounds here. Also
made a bullet graphic but was too lazy to actually add it. Later.

Today, the enemy bites back. It can't actually hurt me though, bullet collisions aren't programmed yet.
