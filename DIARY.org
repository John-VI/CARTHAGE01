Started writing a log of progress on the program. Switched to a radical new diet
recently to lose some weight, threw me off a lot more than I was expecting. Not
too much got done for a while. Writing and rewriting the object manager for
efficiency and safety since we'll be creating and destroying lots of objects
very rapidly.
